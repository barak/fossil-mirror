This patch contains all the Debian-specific changes mixed together.
The reason for doing this, rather than maintaining quilt patches, is
that the Debian-specific changes are maintained as a branch in a
fossil repository.  To review them separately, please inspect the
debian branch in http://people.debian.org/~bap/fossil.fsl
